# Air Traffic Analysis and Prediction  

This repository focuses on analyzing air traffic patterns, uncovering insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predicting optimal travel times using Ridge Regression.  

## Key Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualizations and summaries to explore trends and anomalies in airline operation metrics.  

- **Inference Analysis:**  
  Hypothesis testing to explain variations in air travel patterns.  

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Ridge Regression and feature engineering to optimize R^2. Model predicts future monthly `PricePerSeat` averages for cheapest month identification.  

## Repository Structure  
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for analysis and modeling.  
- `airTraffic_proj.ipynb`: Markdown and code notebook with 3 main sections (EDA, inference and hypothesis development, model development and prediction). 

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-traffic-analysis.git
   cd air-traffic-analysis
